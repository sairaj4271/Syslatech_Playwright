Enterprise-Level Playwright Automation Framework


This project is a full enterprise-grade automation framework built using Playwright + TypeScript.
It follows industry standards used in real companies (POM, fixtures, reusable utilities, runtime storage, logging, validations, retries, etc.)

This README explains:
✔ What this framework does
✔ Folder & file explanations
✔ How it works internally
✔ How to run it
✔ What advanced utilities we created

📌 1. Project Overview

This framework automates:

✅ MakeMyTrip Hotel Booking
✅ MakeMyTrip Flight Booking
✅ Workflow Testing (Bluecopa Portal Example)
✅ Reusable Enterprise Base Framework

It is built using:

Playwright (UI Automation)

TypeScript

Page Object Model (POM)

Reusable Utilities

Runtime Global Storage (very important)

Centralized Logging

Advanced File Utilities

Custom Wait & Retry Utilities

Allure Reporting

📌 2. Why This Framework Is "Enterprise-Level"?

This framework contains real-company level features:

🔥 1. BasePage (Reusable Actions)

Contains:

Safe click

Smart type

Retry actions

Element waits

Select dropdown

Error handling

Screenshot utilities

Page load handling

Central logging

This avoids writing the same Playwright code everywhere.

🔥 2. Runtime Store

This is one of your MOST important utilities.

It stores temporary values during test execution.

Example:

Runtime.set("City", "Goa");
console.log(Runtime.get("City"))


Used for:

Storing dates

Storing city names

Storing selected hotel name

Storing room/guest count

🔥 3. FileUtils

Allows:

✔ Write Excel
✔ Write CSV
✔ Read JSON
✔ Read Excel
✔ Auto-create output folders
✔ Fetch latest file from Downloads

Example:

FileUtils.writeExcel("output/hotels.xlsx", hotelList)

🔥 4. WaitUtils / RetryUtils

Handles flaky UI:

✔ Auto retry failed clicks
✔ Smart wait for element
✔ Handle dynamic Angular/React elements

🔥 5. ConfigManager

Two environments:

dev

qa

Loads from:

env.dev.ts
env.qa.ts


With .env support.

🔥 6. Fixtures (beforeEach, afterEach)

Login before test

Setup browser

Context management

Attach screenshots and videos

🔥 7. Allure Reporting

A fully integrated reporting system:

allure generate
allure open

📌 4. How to Run Tests
✔ Install all packages
npm install

✔ Install browsers
npx playwright install

✔ Run all tests
npx playwright test
